Game freezing solution:
There is a known bug where if you go to a different window while the game is running,

The way to fix this is to exit from the game and start it up again.

Options explained:
Turn animations on/off: Turns the animations used for the game on or off
Change update time: Switches the time in which the AI is updated (before or after the AI chooses a move)
# Iteration: Change the AI type. The earlier the iteration, the worse the AI tends to perform. Best iterations are 4th and 6th
